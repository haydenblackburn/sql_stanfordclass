# Stanford DB5 SQL Class
This is a repository of my solutions for the different assignments and quizzes to complete the well known database class offered
online for free from Stanford. Click [here][1] to try the class out yourself. 

After completing the assignments I compared my code with others on Github and found that a lot of other people use self joins
instead of joins (inner joins) I find it more efficient and easier to read personally. Use this work to assist you, try not 
to just copy and paste or else there's no point in taking the course.
